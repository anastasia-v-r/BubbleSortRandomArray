# CSharpLearning

A basic C# program where an array is generated from a "randomly" generated size value and then populated with random values (duplicates are allowed). 
This list is then sorted using bubblesort. The reason for this very simple project is a starting point in my transition from primarily working in C++, 
to working in both C++ and C#, with a possible full transition to C#.
